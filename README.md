# spacewarweb

Welcome to spacewarweb. I've created this game as a tribute to the classic Spacewar game, created by the first hackers of the MIT AI Lab in 1962. 

## Help Me Build This
The original game was created as a community by the first hackers of MIT. With that spirit, I invite anyone to extend, modify and have fun with this. 

Just fork it, make your modifications and make a pull request. Feel free to contact me if you want to help, need help, or have any feedback. -> merijjeyn@gmail.com

## Getting started
To try it you can head to https://merijjeyn.github.io/spacewar_web/.

To start developing, just fork it, clone it to your local machine, start up a live server (you can just use VSCode's Live Server extension), and head to the port on browser.

> To easily publish to github pages, some dependencies use a cdn. You can also install the necessary packages with npm install and update the dependencies for better intellisense and performance.
